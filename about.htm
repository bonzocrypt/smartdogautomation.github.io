Today we will be discussing the Phillips Hue Starter kit. The Hue combines brilliant LED light with intuitive technology in the palm of your hand. You can experiment with different shades of white or utilize all of the colors in the spectrum. Set the Hue to wake you up, change colors based on activity in your home, or just improve your overall mood with the right color balance.
<br><br>

The basic starter kit comes with 3 light bulbs and a bridge for a retail price of $199, but if you are patient and shop around you can probably find it for $100-125. This kit also includes the Hue Bridge which you will need to control the system. The bridge connects to your Wi-Fi which can then be controlled by a mobile app on your phone no matter where you are. Control the brightness, change the colors, set timers, or control the lights with motion sensors. You can even set it up so that the lights automatically turn on when you arrive home. 
<br><br>

There are multiple versions of Hue lights in addition to the traditional light bulbs. Some popular products include light strips, 
spot lights, and path lights. For more information and product availability check out the <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Phillips Hue website</a>.
